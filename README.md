# All my projects:

## Teaching:

- I participated as a mentor in the RYC initiative for Flutter, a program designed to teach Flutter to beginners. During the initiative, I reviewed and analyzed the course code with the participants, providing guidance, addressing their questions, and supporting the development of their skills. My role also involved reinforcing key concepts and promoting best practices to help students build a strong foundation in Flutter development.[📝 Repository.](https://github.com/rycflutter/udemy-despesas-pessoais)
